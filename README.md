# Machine-Learning-Project-
Startup Success Prediction using Machine Learning
 
 In this project data set was one of the major challenges we've  faced in the early stages. Due to sparse dataset the accuracy of model is a bit substandard . Although the accuracy obtained by each model was  quite significant. It is believed that robust dataset can make the model more perfect. We here have used two seperate dataset for training and testing purpose which provided us more control over our training models . Among all of the casted models the LGBM(Logistic Gradient Boosting Machine ) was the most accurate one .
